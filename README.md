Overview

Text2SVG is an innovative project that transforms textual descriptions into SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) code using large language models (LLMs). Given a description of a scene, object, or icon, the system generates corresponding SVG code to create vector graphics. The project combines advanced LLMs, a curated dataset, similarity-based filtering, and model fine-tuning to produce SVG outputs.
